Things To Work On:
- scoring all FreelanceJobs
  + cannot score SCOUTING jobs until I create scouting function for agency
- scouting job yields actual player
- agents earning XP via jobs
- new forms of income/expenses

New Things To Add:
- different size agencies across the world
- agencies hold market share for each sport?
- after finishing scouting job, you have choice to 
    steal player for yourself but risk ruining repuation 
    with company that offered you the job
- player demands (top tier players demanding private jets, etc.)
- player training
- after signing a 3rd agent, need to create teams (scouting, negotiating)

Things To Add From v1 Of Game:
- Agency calling GM for player
- loan system if out of money
